# GA Project 2: "Reacathon" || 'Owen Wowsen Bible'

## Overview
The second project for the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course was a 28-36 hour pair programming Hackathon. I was paired with my peer Rob, AKA [greezyBob](https://github.com/greezyBob), to collaborate on a plan, wireframe and complete our first app as a group. 

We found a public API which highlights the number of “Wow’s” mentioned by Owen Wilson (the actor) in twelve of his featured films. 

To explore this project, you can find the deployed app via Netlify [here](https://the-great-greezybob-site.netlify.app/).
